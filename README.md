# Chunk-Uploader
Chunk File Uploader

Files for both Pointclouds and Models are uploaded to 3DUserNet using a chunk uploader. This is to enable much larger uploads to be implemented without compromising security or integrity of the files being transferred.

This script has been created as an example implementation for addition of the chunk uploder into your own application.

An additional implementation example can be found in the API example application at our other repository: https://github.com/3DUNAPI/API
